## **Deployment and Containerization**

The New York Sports Site is designed for easy deployment using Docker and Kubernetes. Below is an overview of how the containerization and deployment process works:  

### **Docker**  
- Each component (frontend, backend, database) is containerized using Docker images.  
- A `Dockerfile` is used for each component, specifying dependencies and environment configurations.  
- A `docker-compose.yml` file is included to orchestrate the multi-container setup, ensuring all services work seamlessly together.  

### **Kubernetes**  
- Deployment can scale efficiently using Kubernetes.  
- Kubernetes configurations (`.yaml` files) are available to define:  
  - Deployments for the frontend, backend, and database.  
  - Services to expose the containers to the internet.  
  - Persistent storage for database containers.  
- With Kubernetes, you can deploy the site to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
